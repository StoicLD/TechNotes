# Talking Head Anime

## 一，前言

暂时尝试写一点东西总结





## 二，前期准备

I therefore generated a new dataset specifically for the project. I took advantage of the fact that there are ten of thousands of downloadable 3D models of anime characters, created for a 3D animation software called [MikuMikuDance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance). I downloaded about 8,000 models and used them to render anime faces under random poses. I will discuss the steps to prepare the data in the [Dataset](https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime/#dataset) section.

可以看到数据集来自mikimiku的3D模型数据
